# ✨ Vibe Coding Community

Welcome! This repo is a living collection of the projects we’ve built so far—and a home for what we’ll build next.

We’re here for **vibe coding**: that fun, high-energy flow where ideas turn into working software fast, with AI as a creative teammate. Whether you’re prototyping a tiny tool in an evening or shipping something real with friends, you belong here.

## 🚀 What We’re Building (So Far)

This repository contains a growing set of projects exploring **AI-assisted coding**, creative tooling, and playful experiments. Expect a mix of:

- **Mini apps & prototypes** — fast builds that test an idea quickly  
- **AI coding experiments** — prompts, agents, workflows, and patterns  
- **Dev utilities** — scripts and helpers that make building smoother  
- **Community builds** — collabs, remixes, and shared challenges  

> Each project folder should include its own README with: what it does, how to run it, and what’s next.

## 🧠 Why Vibe Coding?

Because building should feel like:
- momentum over perfection  
- curiosity over fear of “doing it wrong”  
- sharing early, learning in public  
- treating AI like a co-creator, not just an autocomplete  

We’re excited about the future where **anyone can translate ideas into software**—and where communities amplify that power by sharing patterns, prompts, and prototypes.

## 🌱 Our Vision for AI Coding

We’re building a community designed to:
- **spark ideas** (through demos, experiments, and challenges)
- **make building accessible** (templates, walkthroughs, starter kits)
- **ship together** (collaboration, open feedback, remix culture)
- **explore what’s next** (agents, multimodal dev, toolchains, new UX)

AI coding is moving fast. We want this place to be the **campfire**: come share what you made, steal inspiration, and leave with your next build.
